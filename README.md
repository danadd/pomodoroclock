# pomodoroclock
A FCC (free code campe) project for the front end certificate. This project uses Bootstrap and React to create a timer to help students/people stay on track with their study or hobby goals. Users can set a session length for how long they'd like to study/do a particular thing and then set a break length. Lenghts are set in minutes
